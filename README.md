## Setting up dependencies

First, make sure `nodejs` and `npm` are installed. Then, run `npm install` from inside the repo to install dependencies.

You'll also need to make sure `grunt` is installed as a global so it can be run from the command line.
```bash
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```
